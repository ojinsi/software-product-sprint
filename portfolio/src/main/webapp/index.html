      <h1>Omisa's Portfolio!</h1>
      <p>I'm a sophomore at Carnegie Mellon University studying cognitive science and computer science</p>
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>I was born on May 21, 2000 in Singapore, Singapore. I don't remember much about Singapore, 
          because when I was 3 years old, my dad got a job at the World Bank and we moved to 
          Washington DC. I'm now studying cognitive science and computer science at Carnegie Mellon University, and am really interested 
          in artifical intelligence, robotics, human computer interaction, and autonomous agents. 
      </p>
      <h2>Some random facts about me!</h2>

        <li>I recently received my US citizenship, which made me a triple citizen! (Singapore, The Netherlands, and US)</li>
        <li>I'm really passionate about mental health awareness and trying to implement a "Random Acts of Kindness Week" at CMU</li>
        <li>I love watching TED talks and even organized a TEDx event at my high school</li>
